## ruby-coding-challenge

Practice for Ruby problems and `rspec`Ruby testing.

The questions vary in level from quite easy to fairly hard.

Work through them and check if they're correct by running `rspec` after trying some code.

## Getting started
* Delete the answers
* Run `bundle install` in the terminal area
* Answer the first question (in the challenge section)
* Commit the answer and then follow these steps to commit your code
  * $ `git status`
  * $ `git add .`
  * $ `git commit -m "Insert a message"`
  * $ `git push origin master`

* Commit the answer and push it up to your repo
* and repeat to get into the habit of learning both Ruby and Version Control


### How to check your progress

We've written a bunch of tests to help you answer the code. To check your progress as you code along, use this command in your terminal:

~~~
$ rspec questions_spec.rb
~~~


### Tips
* Use the ruby docs http://www.ruby-doc.org/
